# bind9-dyndb-ldap

Bind9 DNS server with the bind-0dyndb-ldap (https://pagure.io/bind-dyndb-ldap) backend driver. The image is based on Debian stable (slim).

## Configuration
`startup.sh` looks for the `named` config file at `/etc/bind/named.conf`. If none is found, it copies the default debian config to `/etc/bind` before starting the server. An `rndc.key` file is also generated if none is found. All files in the `/etc/bind` directory are owned by root and have the group bind (GID=101).

To use your own config, mount a volume containing `named.conf` at `/etc/bind`.

## Build Notes
This project is built with multi-arch support through the `buildx` plugin (https://github.com/docker/buildx). To use this the following steps are necessary (with Docker v19.03 +). These notes are as much for myself as anyone else!

1) [Install](https://github.com/docker/buildx#with-buildx-or-docker-1903 "buildx install notes"): 
```
$ export DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1
$ docker build --platform=local -o . git://github.com/docker/buildx
$ mkdir -p ~/.docker/cli-plugins
$ mv buildx ~/.docker/cli-plugins/docker-buildx
```
2) [Install `binfmt_misc` support](https://github.com/docker/buildx#building-multi-platform-images "buildx - building multi-platform images"):
```
$ docker run --privileged --rm tonistiigi/binfmt --install all
```
3) [Create a specuific builder instance](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/multi-arch/#build-and-run-multi-architecture-images "docker - building multi-platform images"):
```
$ docker buildx create --use --name mybuilder
$ docker buildx inspect --bootstrap
```
(The latter command is only to check we have the additional archs available)

4) Build the image (this automatically uses the selected builder). It's important to log in to Dockerhub (or wherever; e.g. `docker login`) before you run the `--push`:
```
$ docker buildx build --platform linux/amd64,linux/arm/v7 -t <username>/bind9-dyndb-ldap:latest -t <username>/bind9-dyndb-ldap:<ver> --push .
```
There seem to be ways to automate this process with Github/Gitlab... but I haven't investigated these:
- https://www.docker.com/blog/multi-arch-build-and-images-the-simple-way/ (in the "Letâ€™s go to production" section)
- https://github.com/docker/buildx/issues/202#issuecomment-597375245
